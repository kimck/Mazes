#[streaming]

# The LabJack U6 has 14 external analog inputs (AIN0-AIN13) that can be read in 
# streaming mode. AIN0-AIN3 (0,2,4,6) are available on screw terminals and also 
# on the DB37 connector. All 14 analog inputs are available on the DB37 connector. 
# The maximum input range is ±10 volts, with software selectable gains of x1, x10, 
# and x100. Each analog input can be measured single-ended, or differentially in 
# even/odd pairs. Analog input resolution is 16 bits at max speed (~50kHz/#channels), 
# increasing to 18 bits at slower speeds (~4kHz/#channels). Input impedance is at 
# least 1 GΩ, with typical input bias currents of 10 nA. Command/response (software timed) 
# analog input reads take ~1-4 ms depending on number of channels and configuration.

[analog]

# There are 2 analog outputs (DAC0 at register 5000 and DAC1 at register 5002) 
# on the Labjack U6 Pro that can be set to a voltage between ~ 0 and 5 volts 
# with 12-bits of resolution. 

addresses = 5000, 5002

[digital]

# There are 20 digital I/O channels that can be individually configured as input, 
# output-high, or output-low. The first 4 FIO are available on the screw terminals.
# All 8 FIO and 3 MIO are available on the DB37 connector, and 8 EIO and 4 CIO are 
# available on the DB15 connector. Command/response (software timed) reads/writes 
# typically take 1-4 ms.
